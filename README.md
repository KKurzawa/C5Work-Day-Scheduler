# C5 Work Day Scheduler

## Challenge 5 in MSU Bootcamp

This project creates a work day calender in which the current date is displayed, time slots are color coded to past/present/future, and text entries are saved even when the page is refreshed. This is an important tool in organizing ones day to day events. Building this project helped tighten up my JavaScript skills and introduced me to the use of Dayjs.

## Usage

When the page is loaded we see 9 one hour timeslots from 9AM-5PM. Each time slot is color coded: past is grey, present is orange, and future is green. The user can write in the text area and then save what is written by clicking the blue save button. When the page is refreshed the saved input stays in the appropriate place.
